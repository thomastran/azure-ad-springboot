# How to Build and Contribute
Below are guidelines for building and code contribution.

## Prerequisites
- JDK 1.8 and above
- [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) 3.0 and above

## Build from source
To build the project, run maven commands.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-spring-boot.git 
cd azure-spring-boot
mvn clean install
```
*Cloning the git repository on Windows*

Some files in the git repository may exceed the Windows maximum file path (260 characters), depending on where you clone the repository. If you get `Filename too long` errors, set the `core.longPaths=true` git option:
```
git clone -c core.longPaths=true https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-spring-boot.git
cd azure-spring-boot
mvn clean install
```

## Test

- Run unit tests
```bash
mvn clean install
```

- Skip test execution
```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

## Version management
Developing version naming convention is like `2.0.0-SNAPSHOT`. Release version naming convention is like `2.0.0`. Please don't update version if no release plan. 

## CI
Both [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/azure-spring-boot) and [Appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/yungez/azure-spring-boot) CI is enabled.
